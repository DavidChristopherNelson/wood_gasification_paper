# wood_gasification_paper
This is the supplementary material for the paper titled "Wood Gasification: A Promising Strategy to Extend Fuel Reserves After Global Catastrophic Electricity Loss".\n
Each of the plots in the paper are generated from running the Python script that is associated with it. These plots read data from the Numbers spreadsheet so make sure to have that in the same folder as the Python script. The plot will be displayed in a pop up and also saved to the folder that the script is from.
